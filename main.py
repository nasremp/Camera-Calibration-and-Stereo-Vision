# Camera Calibration Stencil Code
# Transferred to python by Eleanor Tursman, based on previous work by Henry Hu,
# Grady Williams, and James Hays for CSCI 1430 @ Brown and
# CS 4495/6476 @ Georgia Tech
#
# This script
# (1) Loads 2D and 3D data points and images
# (2) Calculates the projection matrix from those points    (you code this)
# (3) Computes the camera center from the projection matrix (you code this)
# (4) Estimates the fundamental matrix                      (you code this)
# (5) Adds noise to the points if asked                     (you code this)
# (6) Estimates the fundamental matrix using RANSAC         (you code this)
#     and filters away spurious matches                                    
# (7) Visualizes the F Matrix with homography rectification
#
# The relationship between coordinates in the world and coordinates in the
# image defines the camera calibration. See Szeliski 6.2, 6.3 for reference.
#
# 2 pairs of corresponding points files are provided
# Ground truth is provided for pts2d-norm-pic_a and pts3d-norm pair
# You need to report the values calculated from pts2d-pic_b and pts3d
