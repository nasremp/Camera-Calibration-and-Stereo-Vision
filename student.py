    # Then you can solve this using least squares with the 'np.linalg.lstsq' operator.
    # Notice you obtain 2 equations for each corresponding 2D and 3D point
    # pair. To solve this, you need at least 6 point pairs. Note that we set
    # M34 = 1 in this scenario. If you instead choose to use SVD via np.linalg.svd, you should
    # not make this assumption and set up your matrices by following the 
    # set of equations on the project page.
